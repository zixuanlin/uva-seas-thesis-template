\chapter{Usage\label{ch:usage}}

This \LaTeX{} template and document class \texttt{puthesis.cls}, were adapted from ``Dissertation template and document class for Princeton University''. The Mudd Library website~\cite{mudd2009} provides detailed specifications for how to format your disseration~\cite{muddthesis2009} (for Princeton use). Also, review the ProQuest Dissertation Guide~\cite{proquest2006}, which has additional formatting rules that are important for the submission of the electronic copy of your dissertation. The Princeton University template was created in 2010 by Jeffrey Dwoskin, and adapted from a template provided by the math department. Their original version is available at: \url{http://www.math.princeton.edu/graduate/tex/puthesis.html}

This is \textbf{NOT} an official document. Please verify your school and department requirements before using this template or document class.
